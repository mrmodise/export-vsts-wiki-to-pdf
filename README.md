# Export VSTS Wiki to PDF
Surprisingly, Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Wiki does not support exporting the Wiki to PDF. This is a serious pain in the butt especially if you want to share the Wiki across your organisation. To solve part of this problem (this repo is work-in-progress), this repo will convert your whole wiki to PDF.

## Setup Instructions
This script is work-in-progress. To get started, clone the VSTS Wiki to your preferred location on your computer. Copy the script to the root of the Wiki and execute the script:

> bash clean-convert.sh
